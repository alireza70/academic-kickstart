# Biography

I am a PhD student in the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Shayan Oveis Gharan.
Prior to joining the University of Washington, I earned BS degrees in Mathematics and Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, in Iran.
